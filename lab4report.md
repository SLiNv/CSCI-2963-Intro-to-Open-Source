## [Lab 4](http://rcos.github.io/CSCI2963-01/?content=labs&mode=details&page=Labs%2FLab4.Md&sha=0f3d3dd9d0a8df71f9a363a41c6945da8e50add4) Documentation

As said in the lab handout, documentation is extremely important not only for open source software but any software. It allows users and developers alike to get software running correctly and quickly, reduces frustration, gets new users excited for the software, and enhances programming effort.

I fixed a smalled grammar mistake in [OpenBSD ducumentation](http://www.openbsd.org/faq/pf/carp.html).
