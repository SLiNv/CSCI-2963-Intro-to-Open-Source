Eric Raymond's article gives a very good example on how to construct a good subject header, using the form “object - deviation”, here is the 3 cases he gives:

```
Stupid:
HELP! Video doesn't work properly on my laptop!

Smart:
X.org 6.8.1 misshapen mouse cursor, Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset

Smarter:

###### Do you have more suggestions for How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way? (from your past experience)

- One thing I found very important is that make sure and double check if you understand what people is really asking. The question may seem simple and straight-forward at a glance, if you are not sure, always ask to clarify first in order to better help people.


- Be respectful, enthusiastic.
