## [Lab 2](http://rcos.github.io/CSCI2963-01/?content=labs&mode=details&page=Labs%2FLab2.Md&sha=45d6ca4daf2d73185688b0020aff625738f732c8) Open Source Licensing


1. Read the [four criteria for Free Software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html)

2.  Why it is important to choose a LICENSE?

     The license under which you make your code available has a real impact on what you can do with your code, who will contribute to it, and ultimately whether it gets widely used or ignored. License not only can protect your intellectual property but also can influence how your project will develop.

3.  Why they SHOULDN'T use a project that doesn't have an explicit license 

    The absense of the license of a project implies that default copyright laws applys. This means that the project owner retains all rights to source code and that nobody else may reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works from the work.

4. Read the Failure to follow the Open System Model Section of [Why the Web beat Gopher](http://ils.unc.edu/callee/gopherpaper.htm#explain) 

I agree with the author of this article. Personally I believe that the main reason as to why Gopher failed to beat the web was because the web has much better infrastructure. The technology that Gopher used would be unable to support the web traffic that exists today.

5.  Android uses the [Apache license 2.0 and it's kernel uses GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Android_(operating_system)), [Linux uses tge  GPL v2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux ) license, 
Microsoft [.NET Core uses MIT license]( https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr ), SailfishOS is [not open source]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailfish_OS ).  
    
    According to Google, "Android is about freedom and choice. The purpose of Android is promote openness in the mobile world, and we don't believe it's possible to predict or dictate all the uses to which people will want to put our software."
    
    Permissive licenses that are preferred by many companies because such licenses provide a choice of whether you have to distribute your code or a derivative work to make the source available under the same terms, in oppose to force people to turn proprietary enhancements back over to the open source community.

6.  Think of an example project. Pick a license (as a group) using the [LICENSE chooser by Github](http://choosealicense.com/).

    I would choose GPL V3 because I would like the project to be "prosperous" and people not only take it but also give back.


7.  Read these licenses  GPL, LGPL and Apache/BSD and discuss which one will be better - for a developer, for a company and for the common good - write 5 to 10 sentences. You may use [tldrlegal](https://tldrlegal.com/license/)
- Developer - It really depents on how the develop think...
- Company - Copyleft license, it doesn't allow others to release under proprietary license
- Common good - permissive

8.  Create a repsotiory and [choose a license](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license)

9.  Take 5 projects from [Observatory](http://rcos.io) - create a table which project has which license. for example:

|Website | License Present | License|
|---------|----------|-------|
|https://github.com/rcos/Observatory | Yes | Two Clause BSD License https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISC_license|
|HWserver|Yes|BSD License|
|pandamonium|No||
|Pokedex|No||
|Chrometana|Yes|The MIT License|

10. Write five sentences about choosing a project to work in this course and who will be users/customers and what license will you choose. 

I am still searching a project to work on. I would  preferably do a light-weight or smaller project using C++ or JAVA instead of web-based projects.
